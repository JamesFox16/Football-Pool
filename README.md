# Football-Pool
Football pool project that allows users to choose winners of college and pro football games.

## Why this project exists
This is a project that will change the way that my fathers football pool is run. There are users who will select winners of selected football games. If the user selects the correct pick, they will be awarded a point. If the user selects an incorrect pick, they will not be awarded a point. The user with the most points at the end of all games is the winner for that week.

## Tools
This software will use the VI Consensus for the odds of each game. The odds will be locked in at a given time to make the picks for each game fair.

## Disclaimer
This software will not handle any bets or recieve any money from users reguarding the games. This is not the intended use for the software. The software will just use the VI Consensus as a way to judge the picks of each game.
